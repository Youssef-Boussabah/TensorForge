# Roadmap

## Where the project is

**v3.0 is the completed Python framework release.** You
can define a model (including CNNs), train it, regularize it,
normalize it, evaluate it honestly, save it, and resume it bit-for-bit
— all from readable NumPy code, all tested, all documented. For the
version-by-version story, see [release_history.md](release_history.md);
for a two-minute overview, see [project_summary.md](project_summary.md).

## What's been built

**v0.x — foundations.** The Tensor and autograd engine (elementwise
ops, matmul, exp/log/tanh/sigmoid/relu/softmax with broadcasting-aware
gradients), the module system (Parameter, Module, Linear, activations,
Sequential), SGD, MSE and cross-entropy losses, and the first
examples: linear regression, XOR, and the multi-class spiral.

**v1.x — training basics and evaluation.** The accuracy metric, Adam,
mini-batching, gradient checking against finite differences,
save/load parameters, model summaries and parameter counting, frozen
parameters, train/validation splitting, evaluation helpers, binary
cross-entropy with a binary classification example, and checkpoints
that capture optimizer state so training can resume exactly.

**v2.x — deeper framework features.** Train/eval mode, Dropout (and an
example that uses it properly), eval-safe evaluators, BatchNorm1d with
module buffers, gradient clipping, the StepLR scheduler, scheduler
state in checkpoints — completing the training-resume story — and
image-shaped input: Conv2d, MaxPool2d, Flatten, and a tiny CNN
example; LayerNorm as the batch-independent normalization; optional
RNG state in checkpoints for bit-exact dropout resume; and a
release-readiness pass over docs and guardrail tests.

## Practical next steps

The Python line is done; what remains is expansion on its own terms:

- **Advanced branches** — the C++ backend experiment now has
  elementwise kernels, naive and cache-tiled 2-D matmuls, an
  introspection API, honest benchmarks against NumPy, and a native
  runtime prototype: shape/stride metadata, a C++-owned NativeStorage
  buffer, and NativeTensorView binding the two with native contiguous
  materialization
  (see [backend_experiments.md](backend_experiments.md)). CUDA/GPU
  experiments are still entirely future work. The Python framework
  stays the reference implementation.
- **A larger synthetic image example** — more classes, bigger images,
  still dependency-free.
- **More docs** — deeper walkthroughs of individual layers, if the
  framework grows further.

## What this project is not

TensorForge is not production software and doesn't try to compete with
PyTorch or any real framework. It trades performance for readability
at every opportunity — that's the point. If it helps someone
understand what `loss.backward()` actually does, it has succeeded.
