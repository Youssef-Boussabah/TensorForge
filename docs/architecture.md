# Architecture

TensorForge is a mini deep learning framework written in Python and
NumPy. It exists to show how a framework like PyTorch works under the
hood, so every piece is deliberately small and readable. There is no
C++, no GPU code, and no dependency besides NumPy.

## How the pieces fit together

**Tensor** (`tensor.py`) is the foundation. It wraps a NumPy array and
records enough information to run backpropagation. Everything else in
the framework is built on top of Tensor operations — see
[autograd.md](autograd.md) for how that works.

**Parameter** is a Tensor subclass that always has
`requires_grad=True`. Being a distinct class is what lets the rest of
the framework find trainable state by type.

**Module** is the base class for layers and models. It discovers
Parameters by walking its own attributes (including child modules and
lists of modules), which gives every model `parameters()`,
`state_dict()`, `summary()`, and train/eval mode for free — no
registration calls needed. Modules can also declare non-trainable
*buffers* (like BatchNorm's running statistics) that travel with
`state_dict()` but are never optimized.

**Layers** (Linear, activations, Dropout, BatchNorm1d, Conv2d,
Flatten) are small Module subclasses. Each one implements `forward()`
using Tensor operations, so gradients flow through them automatically
(Conv2d is the exception — it's a fused op with an explicit backward,
because composing a convolution from elementwise ops would be
unreadable). Conv2d works on image-shaped `(batch, channels, height,
width)` input, and Flatten bridges that back to the `(batch, features)`
shape Linear expects. Sequential chains layers so the output of one
feeds the next.

**Losses** are either plain Tensor expressions (`mse_loss`) or fused
operations with a hand-written backward pass where numerical stability
demands it (`cross_entropy`, `binary_cross_entropy`).

**Optimizers** (SGD, Adam) are plain classes, not Modules. They hold a
list of Parameters and update `param.data` from `param.grad` in
`step()`. They skip parameters with no gradient and frozen parameters
(`requires_grad=False`). Gradient clipping and the StepLR scheduler
sit alongside them in `optim/`.

**Examples** tie it all together. Each one is a standalone script with
a `train()` function (so tests can import and run it) and a `main()`
that prints progress. See [examples.md](examples.md).

## Design habits

A few conventions hold across the codebase:

- Forward computation is eager NumPy; only the gradient bookkeeping is
  deferred.
- Comments explain math and autograd reasoning, not obvious Python.
- Randomness is always seedable: helpers take a `seed` argument and
  use their own `np.random.default_rng` rather than global state.
- Every feature ships with tests, and training tests assert learning
  (loss decreased, accuracy above a threshold) rather than exact
  floating-point values.
