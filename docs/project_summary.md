# TensorForge — project summary

A two-minute overview for anyone landing on this repository.

## What TensorForge is

TensorForge is a from-scratch deep learning framework built in
Python + NumPy — a serious, Daedalus-inspired ML systems project. It
reimplements the core machinery of a framework like PyTorch —
automatic differentiation, neural network modules, optimizers,
checkpointing, CNN support — in small, readable code, plus an
experimental native C++ backend. NumPy is the only dependency. It was
built milestone by milestone (v0.1 through v3.0 and beyond), each one
tested and documented.

## What TensorForge implements

- A `Tensor` with reverse-mode autograd: arithmetic, matmul, reshape,
  reductions, and the common nonlinearities, with broadcasting-aware
  gradients verified against finite differences.
- A module system: `Parameter`, `Module`, `Linear`, `Sequential`,
  activations, `Dropout`, `BatchNorm1d`, `LayerNorm`, `Conv2d`,
  `MaxPool2d`, `Flatten`, with train/eval mode, model summaries, and
  parameter freezing.
- Losses (MSE, cross-entropy, binary cross-entropy — the latter two as
  numerically stable fused ops), metrics, and eval-safe evaluation
  helpers.
- Training tools: SGD, Adam, StepLR scheduling, gradient clipping,
  mini-batching, and train/validation splitting.
- Persistence: save/load for weights, and full checkpoints carrying
  optimizer state, scheduler state, JSON metadata, and optionally the
  RNG state — so training resumes bit-for-bit, dropout included.

## Design principles

Every design decision favors readability and verifiable correctness.
Operations carry short comments explaining their local derivative;
tricky pieces (stable losses, batchnorm statistics, max-pool gradient
routing) explain *why* they work, not just what they do. Where
possible, layers are built by composing existing autograd ops so their
gradients need no new code — and where a fused op is necessary,
finite-difference tests prove the hand-written backward correct.

## Example learning path

The six runnable examples form a progression, each introducing one
idea: linear regression (the bare training loop), XOR (why hidden
layers exist), a 3-class spiral (real classification, mini-batches,
validation), binary classification (logits and stable losses), a
dropout MLP (train mode vs eval mode), and a tiny CNN (convolution,
pooling, and flattening on synthetic images). All are seeded,
dependency-free, and finish in seconds.

## Testing and reliability

370+ pytest tests cover every feature: known-value checks against
hand-computed math, finite-difference gradient verification, exact
resume-equivalence tests for checkpointing, and guardrail tests that
keep docs, examples, and the public API from drifting apart. The suite
runs in a few seconds.

## Current limitations

Not production-ready and not a PyTorch replacement. NumPy on CPU
only; `Conv2d` and `MaxPool2d` use deliberately naive loops. No real
datasets, no external ML libraries. The native C++ backend is an
experimental research line (elementwise kernels, a naive matmul,
honest benchmarks) and is not wired into Tensor/autograd; there is no
CUDA backend.

## What comes after v3.0

v3.0 closes the Python framework line. Work continues on advanced
branches: the experimental C++ backend is underway (compiled kernels,
CI-verified builds, honest benchmarks, an introspection API), and
CUDA/GPU experiments remain future work. See
[release_history.md](release_history.md) for the full arc.
