# TensorForge — project summary

A two-minute overview for anyone landing on this repository.

## What TensorForge is

TensorForge is a from-scratch deep learning framework built in
Python + NumPy — a serious, Daedalus-inspired ML systems project. It
reimplements the core machinery of a framework like PyTorch —
automatic differentiation, neural network modules, optimizers,
checkpointing, CNN support — in small, readable code, plus an
experimental native C++ backend. NumPy is the only dependency. It was
built milestone by milestone (v0.1 through v3.0 and beyond), each one
tested and documented.

## What TensorForge implements

- A `Tensor` with reverse-mode autograd: arithmetic, matmul, reshape,
  reductions, and the common nonlinearities, with broadcasting-aware
  gradients verified against finite differences.
- A module system: `Parameter`, `Module`, `Linear`, `Sequential`,
  activations, `Dropout`, `BatchNorm1d`, `LayerNorm`, `Conv2d`,
  `MaxPool2d`, `Flatten`, with train/eval mode, model summaries, and
  parameter freezing.
- Losses (MSE, cross-entropy, binary cross-entropy — the latter two as
  numerically stable fused ops), metrics, and eval-safe evaluation
  helpers.
- Training tools: SGD, Adam, StepLR scheduling, gradient clipping,
  mini-batching, and train/validation splitting.
- Persistence: save/load for weights, and full checkpoints carrying
  optimizer state, scheduler state, JSON metadata, and optionally the
  RNG state — so training resumes bit-for-bit, dropout included.

## Design principles

Every design decision favors readability and verifiable correctness.
Operations carry short comments explaining their local derivative;
tricky pieces (stable losses, batchnorm statistics, max-pool gradient
routing) explain *why* they work, not just what they do. Where
possible, layers are built by composing existing autograd ops so their
gradients need no new code — and where a fused op is necessary,
finite-difference tests prove the hand-written backward correct.

## Example learning path

The six runnable examples form a progression, each introducing one
idea: linear regression (the bare training loop), XOR (why hidden
layers exist), a 3-class spiral (real classification, mini-batches,
validation), binary classification (logits and stable losses), a
dropout MLP (train mode vs eval mode), and a tiny CNN (convolution,
pooling, and flattening on synthetic images). All are seeded,
dependency-free, and finish in seconds.

## The experimental native line

The advanced branch adds a second, strictly separate framework line: a
native C++ CPU backend reached explicitly through
`tensorforge.experimental`. **Phase A (native CPU runtime) is
complete** — `NativeStorage` → `NativeTensorView` → `NativeTensorCore`
→ `NativeTensor`, with explicit ownership/lifetime, strided views,
broadcasting, sum/mean reductions, and float64/cpu metadata over
ctypes-loaded C++ kernels. **Phase B (native autograd) is complete** —
a Python-managed reverse-mode graph over autograd-unaware kernels,
with fourteen differentiable operations (the v3.11 optimizer math
primitives sqrt and reciprocal included), view/broadcast gradients, and a
defined graph lifetime. **Phase C (the native training stack) is in
progress** and already trains end to end: `NativeParameter` (value
versioning, stale-graph safety), `NativeModule` with atomic state
dictionaries, `NativeLinear`/`NativeReLU`/`NativeSequential`,
`NativeMSELoss`, `NativeSGD`, and a deterministic MLP training proof
(`examples/native_mlp_training.py` — 25 native SGD steps, monotonic
99.5% loss reduction). The two engines never mix: explicit entry via
`NativeTensor.from_array`, explicit exit via `to_numpy()`, no implicit
dispatch. The exact per-operation status lives in the
[native support matrix](native_support_matrix.md).

## Testing and reliability (both lines)

1262 pytest tests cover every feature of both lines: known-value
checks against hand-computed math, finite-difference gradient
verification (stable and native), exact resume-equivalence tests for
checkpointing, NumPy-tripwire tests proving the native paths never
fall back, and guardrail tests keeping docs, examples, and the public
API from drifting. Native tests skip cleanly when the backend is not
built; CI builds it from source and runs everything.

## Current limitations

Not production-ready and not a PyTorch replacement. The stable
framework is NumPy on CPU; `Conv2d` and `MaxPool2d` use deliberately
naive loops. The native line is float64/cpu only — no CUDA backend,
no dtype promotion or casting, no native CNN stack, no adaptive native
optimizer, no native optimizer state or checkpointing yet, and no
dispatch into `tensorforge.Tensor`. Benchmarks are hardware-specific
characterizations, never universal speed claims. No real datasets, no
external ML libraries.

## What comes after v3.0

v3.0 closed the Python framework line. The advanced branch then built
the native line milestone by milestone (v1.x runtime, v2.x autograd,
v3.1–v3.9 training stack) to its first major checkpoint, v3.10. Next
on the native line: optimizer math primitives, an adaptive optimizer,
optimizer state, native checkpointing, and Phase C completion — then
the native CNN stack, the CUDA runtime, dtype/AMP work, and
Transformer/text and distributed experiments. See
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md) and [release_history.md](release_history.md)
for the full arc.
