"""Experimental, opt-in APIs built on the native C++ backend.

Nothing here is part of the finished Python framework, and
``import tensorforge`` never imports this package — you reach it
explicitly:

    from tensorforge.experimental import NativeTensor

``NativeTensor`` is a native tensor wrapper over the native runtime
(NativeTensorCore) with an opt-in, Python-managed reverse-mode autograd
graph (Phase B, complete as of Advanced C++ v2.6). It is **not**
tensorforge.Tensor: the two autograd engines never mix, no conversion is
implicit, and it has no optimizer/training integration and no CUDA.

``NativeParameter`` and ``NativeParameterRegistry`` (Advanced C++ v3.1,
the first Phase C step) add the native training stack's trainable-leaf
abstraction and the minimal parameter-registration contract, and
``NativeModule`` (Advanced C++ v3.2) is the module-hierarchy core built
on them: automatic parameter/child registration through attribute
assignment, deterministic identity-deduplicated recursive traversal,
recursive ``zero_grad()``, and ``train()``/``eval()`` state propagation
— plus the in-memory state dictionary contract (Advanced C++ v3.3):
``state_dict()`` snapshots and atomic identity-preserving
``load_state_dict()``, parameters only. No layers, losses, optimizers,
file serialization, or training loop yet, and still fully separate from
``tensorforge.nn``.

Constructors need the experimental C++ backend to be built; importing
this package is always safe (the library loads lazily on first use).
